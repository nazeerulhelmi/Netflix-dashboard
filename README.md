I am from Malaysia. Netflix was not a thing while growing up. I was exposed to Netflix while doing my undergraduate study in Utah back in 2015-2019. After graduated and coming back to Malaysia, Netflix is the only website available, or at least one that does not required us Malaysian to pay in US Dollar. No Amazon Prime Video. No Hulu. No HBO Max. Netflix is the only to go. So, I am intrigued to know how it was performing a couple years ago.
